Hello and welcome to the Illuminum Mod!

This is a very work in progress content mod that just adds some simple content. Nothing too fancy!

Currently there are 150+ Items total in this mod, Including:
9 Armor Sets
41 Accessories
17 Materials
3 Tools
2 Crafting Station
4 Enemies
2 Critters
68 Weapons - 37 Melee - 14 Ranged - 9 Magic - 8 Summoner
2 Blocks
1 Boss
1 Biome
1 Town NPC
2 Exclusive Themes

Currently the mod is kinda small but I will be trying to update it as much as I can to add some interesting content for your everyday modded runs!
